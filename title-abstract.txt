Title:
Privacy in Practice: The Feasibility of Differential Privacy for Telemetry Analysis

Abstract:
This research investigates the implementation implications of differential privacy mechanisms for telemetry data analysis, with a focus on real-world applications. We show, through examples, how knowledge of fundamental privacy-preserving techniques, including randomized response and the Laplace mechanism, is enough to protect sensitive information while maintaining analytical utility. We privatize data tasks from 4 applied research works using Intel telemetry data which   encompasses multiple statistical tasks, from user-level rate analysis to logistic regression classification. The study utilizes various $(\epsilon, \delta)$ budgets (using AutoDP) for precise privacy loss measurement and to quantify the inherent tradeoff between privacy and utility. By demonstrating the feasibility of differential privacy in production environments, we provide a roadmap for organizations seeking to enhance their privacy practices.
