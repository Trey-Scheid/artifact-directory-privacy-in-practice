Title:
Privacy in Practice: The Feasibility of Differential Privacy for Telemetry Analysis

Abstract:
This research investigates the practical implementation of differential privacy mechanisms for telemetry data analysis, with a focus on real-world applications. We propose a comprehensive framework that employs various privacy-preserving techniques, including randomized response and the Laplace mechanism, to protect sensitive information while maintaining analytical utility. Our methodology encompasses multiple statistical tasks, from user-level rate analysis to logistic regression classification. The study utilizes AutoDP for precise privacy loss measurement and documents the inherent tradeoffs between privacy guarantees and analytical accuracy in production environments. By demonstrating the feasibility of differential privacy in telemetry analysis, we provide a roadmap for organizations seeking to enhance their privacy practices.
